## 🚀 What is Ananke?

**Ananke** is a powerful, local-first desktop application designed to simplify the management of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers and AI **Skills**. 

Managing MCP configurations often involves wrestling with complex JSON files and command-line interfaces. Ananke provides a sleek visual interface to install, configure, and monitor your AI tools—keeping your data private and your workflow efficient.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Visual Management**: Toggle, configure, and update MCP servers via a clean GUI. No more manual JSON editing.
- **Local-first Architecture**: Your configurations and keys stay on your machine. Privacy is not a feature; it's the foundation.
- **Skill Hub**: Discover and deploy new capabilities to your AI models with a single click.
